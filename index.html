        <p class="paragraph2">We as a group decided to establish this club in order to help the youth with the basics of coding and robotics. We are a group of students who are expert developers and designers and willing to share our knowledge with the youth at no cost. Back when we started coding as absolute beginners, we had no mentors who helped us learn the basics of coding, we don't want the same issue to repeat hence we decided to organize this club to help everyone who's interested.
          All of us are experts in our fields and we are here to help you learn and grow. Choose your favorite course and get expert guidance from our team of experts who will get you up and running within a few weeks. Coding can't be mastered overnight but with practice and guidance, it can be achieved. <b><u>Let us introduce ourselves and our area of expertise:</u></b> <br><br>
